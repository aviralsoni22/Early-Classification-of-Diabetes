# Early-Classification-of-Diabetes
This project focuses on the early classification of diabetes using two popular machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and Random Forest Classification.
Key Features:

* ML models trained with and without utilizing the SMOTE technique to address class imbalance.

* Evaluation of model accuracies through confusion matrix and k-Fold cross-validation.

* Comparison of accuracies between different models.
